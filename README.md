The Simple Python Dictionary App is a multifunctional vocabulary learning tool designed to help users easily manage and expand their vocabulary. The app supports adding, deleting, and updating words, and allows users to switch between Chinese and English in the interface. It provides a web content import feature for users with different language backgrounds, making vocabulary learning and management more efficient. By importing words from given and custom web links (such as content related to numbers, food, Deltarune, and Undertale), users can quickly expand their dictionary content to meet personalized learning needs.
